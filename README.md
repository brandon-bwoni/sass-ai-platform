# AI-Generated Content SaaS Platform

## Overview

This project is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to generate content in various formats, including text-based chats, images, and code snippets. Additionally, it integrates with Replica AI to provide music and video generation capabilities. This project highlights my expertise in working with APIs, building SaaS applications, and utilizing a stack that includes Next.js 13, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Stripe, and Clerk for authentication.
